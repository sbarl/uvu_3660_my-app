Work flow
git pull, tell it where git repository is (ours is origin, github url)
    till it what branch to pull (for now main)
when you add a new feature, "trunk phase" work flow (trunk is main)
    we dont just develop off of trunk  
    when we make changes we make 

!! need to organize my devlopment so I commit after each main change and not 
    doing a bunch of stuff

whenever we're gong to do work on our code we're gonna branch out, work on it, test it
    merge it into main then deploy to cloud front

main is the latest working release always. 


vocab:
git status
git branch [branch name]
git checkout
git checkout [branch name]
git pull origin main
npm run build
npm run dev

commit, stage, conflict, merge,


start on branch main
create a branch(not on it yet): git branch [branch main]
move to branch you maid: git checkout [branch main]
tell you you're on new branch, none to commit: git status
    returns -> nothing to commit



good design principles: Grid for pages, consitancy to make it intuitive

a component, main layout, funcitons
two ways to create component in jsx:
    do a function, returns jsx code (EASIER)
    create a class and extend reacts component class, create render which returns jsx

how to use componenets in other components:
    point of react is to put components in other components

main layout takes two properties


when done working for the day:
    git status -> shows untracked folders
    git add .\src\layouts\
    git add .\src\pages\
    git status
    !changes to be commited: [list of files]

    git commit -m "message"

    after commit, push, dont want to push to main branch?
    push to branch

    git push origin [branch name]



    children and title in MainLayout.jsx are expecting to be
    passed. they are the porperties and can pass them in differnt ways.

    use effect, is a hook. pass use effect function and array? 

    components in the end are just xml


    can add bootstrap in a lot of different ways.
